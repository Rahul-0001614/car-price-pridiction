This is a supervised machine learning project for old car price prediction. I am making a Jupyter notebook file for model training and creating a Flask webpage for car price prediction using HTML.
My model successfully runs, and the accuracy is around 94.00% 

i am also creating two web pages 

         1. Flask 
         2. streamlit 
         Both are working properly
